            <h2>Attacking and Defending</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cards can attack when they are in the <b style="color: #ff9800;">front row</b> and can target the next enemy card in front of them.</li>
                <li>If there is a card in the <b style="color: #0288d1;">2nd row</b> and there's an empty space between your card and the opponent's, you can attack it. Same goes for the <b style="color: #0288d1;">3rd row</b> and 2 spaces between your card and the opponent's.</li>
                <li>Each card has an <b>attack</b> and a <b>defense</b> stat. Resolve as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equal attack and defense: <b style="color: #e91e63;">Both cards are destroyed</b>.</li>
                        <li>Attack greater than defense: <b style="color: #4caf50;">Only the defending card is destroyed</b>.</li>

        <section id="card-play-costs">
            <h2>Card Play Costs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cards are categorized into 5 tiers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and Tokens), affecting their play cost:</li>
                <li>A token is a type of card that does not go in your deck. You can have an unlimited amount of them on the field and you are only limited by how many your cards can "Create".</li>
                <li>Tokens have no attack or defense.</li>
                <li>When a card says "Create" you play a card that does not exist in your deck such as a Token.</li>
                <li>Tier 0 cards are free to play.</li>
                <li>Tier 1 cards require destroying another card to play. Destroying a card sends it to the discard pile. To destroy a card, it must be in play on your side of the field.</li>
                <li>Higher tier cards require destroying cards whose total tier equals the tier of the card you wish to play or a number of cards equal to the tier of the card.
                    <ul>
                        <li>e.g., To play a tier 4 card, you would need to destroy one of the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Any 4 cards</li>
                                <li>2 x Tier 2 cards</li>
                                <li>1 x Tier 1 + 1 x Tier 3</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Arrows</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Movement and Effects:</b> Arrows indicate possible movement and effect directions.</li>
                <li><b>Jumping:</b> If an arrow points to the edge of the field, spend two actions to jump to the opposite side.</li>
                <li><b>Restrictions:</b> Cards cannot affect or cross the center line even if their arrow points towards it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cards are considered linked if their arrows touch on any side, which can activate certain effects.</p>

        <section id="win-condition">
            <h2>Win Condition</h2>
            <p>Each player starts with <b style="color: #f44336;">3 hit points</b>. Direct attacks are possible if a card with attack is in the front row and faces a column without defense cards. <b>Hit points</b> are lost by direct attacks, and the game ends when a player reaches <b>0 hit points</b>.</p>
