            <p>Cards are categorized into 5 tiers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and Tokens), affecting their play cost:</p>
            <ul class="card-tiers">
                <li><b>Tokens:</b> Tokens do not go in your deck. You can have an unlimited amount on the field, limited only by how many your cards can "Create". Tokens have no attack or defense.</li>
                <li><b>Tier 0:</b> Free to play.</li>
                <li><b>Tier 1:</b> Requires destroying another card to play. Destroying a card sends it to the discard pile. The card must be in play on your side of the field.</li>
                <li><b>Higher Tiers:</b> Require destroying cards whose total tier equals the tier of the card you wish to play, or a number of cards equal to the tier of the card. <br>For example, to play a Tier 4 card, you would need to destroy one of the following:</li>
